### Code Overview

The `Cart` component is the main component of the application. It uses the `useCart` hook from `react-use-cart` to manage the cart state. The component displays the cart items, the total price, and a checkout button.

The `CartItem` component is a reusable component that displays a single cart item. It includes the product name, quantity, and price.

The `makeSale` function is responsible for making a sale. It takes the sale amount, product ID, and quantity as arguments and returns the result of the sale.

The `useMutation` hook from `@tanstack/react-query` is used to handle the sale mutation. It provides a `mutateAsync` method that can be called to make a sale.

The `handleSubmit` function is called when the checkout button is clicked. It iterates over the cart items and makes a sale for each item. If the sale is successful, the item is removed from the cart.
